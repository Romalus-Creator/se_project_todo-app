# Simple Todo App

This Todo App is a webpage designed to allow users to add and remove tasks. The users can also add due dates on the tasks as well as check the tasks once completed - hooray for little seratonin releases!

## Functionality

The ToDo class establishes how a task is created - whether 'original' to the webpage or a new one created by the user.
The FormValidation class - validates the form.
In the index.js, the code has been significantly reduced from the original file thanks to the ToDo class being created in a separate file. The index.js file initiates the first 3 tasks on the webpage, appends any new tasks created by the user, and deletes a task that the user clicks the delete button on.

## Technology

<!-- Give a description of the technologies and techniques used. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features are recommended. -->

Consists of a single html file, 3 Javascript files, and CCS blocks using the BEM methodology.

This is my first take at Javascript OOP in a project. It is a way to understand how to refactor JS code into the more organized OOP Class system - rather than just cramming all funcitonality on the index.js file.
